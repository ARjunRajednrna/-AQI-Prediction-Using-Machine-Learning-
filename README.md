# -AQI-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
Developed a hybrid model combining XGBoost and CNN for accurate AQI forecasting using Python. Compared with Logistic Regression, SVM, and Holtâ€™s Linear Exponential Smoothing. Achieved 97% accuracy. Used RMSE, MAPE, and cross-validation for validation. Integrated real-time visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
