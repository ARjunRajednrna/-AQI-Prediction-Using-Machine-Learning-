# AQI Prediction and Trend Analysis Using Machine Learning

## üìò Overview

This project presents a hybrid machine learning and deep learning model to accurately predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) and analyze long-term pollution trends. Conducted as part of a B.Sc. IT academic submission at Thakur College of Science and Commerce, the study integrates a variety of ML techniques‚Äîincluding Logistic Regression, SVM, CNN, and XGBoost‚Äîwith Holt‚Äôs Linear Exponential Smoothing for enhanced AQI forecasting. It aims to support public health and environmental planning through reliable real-time air quality predictions.

## üß† Key Objectives

- Predict concentrations of major pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, and O‚ÇÉ.
- Classify AQI into standard categories (Good to Severe) using ML classifiers.
- Forecast future AQI values using time-series models for proactive health alerts.
- Compare performance between traditional ML models and hybrid deep learning systems.

## üß™ Techniques and Methodologies

- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost
- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Hybrid Modeling**: Stacked ensemble integrating CNN, XGBoost, and Linear Regression
